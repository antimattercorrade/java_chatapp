## Chat Application in Java

This is a chat application made in java. Original code is provided by Anurag Saini (@anuragsn7 at CodeProject). 
I have integrated the app with mySQL database and implemented the history feature.

The project is licensed under The Code Project Open License (CPOL).

### Configuration:

1) Install mySQL and mysql jdbc plugin for java.
2) Change the password in the files "History.java" and "LoginDatabase.java" to your password of mySQL database.
3) Change the database name from "chat" to your database name in the files "History.java" and "LoginDatabase.java".
4) Compile the code and run LoginFrame.
5) Start the server.
6) Run multiple instances of ChatClient to start chat.
