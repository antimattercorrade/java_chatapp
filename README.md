## Chat Application in Java

This is a chat application made in java. Original code is provided by Anurag Saini (@anuragsn7 at CodeProject). 
I have integrated the app with mySQL database and implemented the hostory feature.

### Configuration:

1) Install mySQL and mysql jdbc driver for java.
2) Change the password in files "History.java" and "LoginDatabase.java" to your new password.
3) Compile the code and run LoginFrame.
4) Start the server.
5) Run multiple instances of ChatClient to start chat.
